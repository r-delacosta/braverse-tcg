### FAQ

- Will there be iOS version?
    - There are currently no plans to develop an iOS version.
- Is offline support available?
    - The app requires an internet connection to fetch data from the official CookieRun website.
    - Offline support may be added in future releases, but there is no target rollout date.
- Why do filtered results seem inaccurate at times?
    - All card data are pulled directly from the CookieRun website. That means using the same filters on both platforms will return the same results. If you notice any inaccuracy, please report a ticket (refer to Bugs section below)
